determining probability given environment host initiating tcp connection host received record track various application level response time personally love lot data ratio dns response time tcp transfer time http connection even measurement make attempt discern constitutes web transaction user full page usually many tcp connection anyway think fairly interesting thing measure simple technique simple one may interesting thing could digging payload highly utilized application tcp nightmare perfomance wise basic infrastructure thing dns udp probably cover open udp protocol without incurring performance penalty would make completely unusable snmp example application limited network service provider would find round trip time information snmp packet network management station
